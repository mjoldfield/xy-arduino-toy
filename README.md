# xy-arduino-toy

A toy XY display using an Arduino and small LCD display. It is
essentially a marriage of the example for the
[Adafruit 2.2" TFT display](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1480)
and Guy van den Berg’s [ADC tweaks](http://www.microsmart.co.za/technical/2014/03/01/advanced-arduino-adc/)
for the Arduino.

Little else need be said, but I wrote [about it](http://mjoldfield.com/atelier/2015/11/cheap-xy-display.html)
anyway.

A lightly modified version of the code is used in my 
[Cartesian Dualism geocache.](https://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC5WKF3)
